## Installation

Install the gem

```
gem install dag
```

Or add it to your Gemfile and run `bundle`.

``` ruby
gem 'dag'
```

## Usage

```ruby
dag = DAG.new

v1 = dag.add_vertex
v2 = dag.add_vertex
v3 = dag.add_vertex

dag.add_edge from: v1, to: v2
dag.add_edge from: v2, to: v3

v1.path_to?(v3)                  # => true
v3.path_to?(v1)                  # => false

dag.add_edge from: v3, to: v1        # => ArgumentError: A DAG must not have cycles

dag.add_edge from: v1, to: v2
dag.add_edge from: v1, to: v3
v1.successors                        # => [v2, v3]
```

See the specs for more detailed usage scenarios.
